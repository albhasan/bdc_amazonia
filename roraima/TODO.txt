NOTES ON CLASSIFICATION USING SAMPLES FROM PRODES & MAPBIOMAS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The initial experiment collected samples using automatic random sampling of
deforestation from MAPBIOMAS and the other classes from PRODES. The argument was
that MAPBIOMAS consolidates deforestation poligons from several sources
(including PRODES) are are precise. However, the results were bad.

Results seven bands and cloud interpolation using local sits configuration
(v003). Deforestation poligons aren't regular, they look like clouds and there
is a lot of confusion of deforestation of the classification year with
deforestation from previous years.

A visual inspection reveals spatial correlation of classification results with
fire spots.

It seems the samples are represetative of fire scars instead of deforestation.
This would explain the confusion in deforestation since present-day burn scars
are common in deforesation from former years. This would also explain the
irregular shape of the deforestation since the fire seem to be more related to
topography or wind than to human control.
